# ST331: Regression Analysis Course Syllabus

## Course Description
This course covers the theory and application of regression analysis, focusing on simple and multiple linear regression, model diagnostics, and practical implementation using RStudio.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into 5 main modules:

1.  **Module 1: Introduction to Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**
    *   Theory: Least Squares Estimation, Assumptions.
    *   Manual Calculation: Estimating $\beta_0, \beta_1$, ANOVA table.
    *   RStudio: `lm()` function, basic plotting.
2.  **Module 2: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**
    *   Theory: Matrix approach, Interpretation of coefficients.
    *   Manual Calculation: Matrix operations for MLR.
    *   RStudio: Multi-variable models, $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$.
3.  **Module 3: Model Diagnostics and Remedial Measures**
    *   Theory: Residual analysis, Multicollinearity, Heteroscedasticity.
    *   RStudio: Diagnostic plots, Transformations.
4.  **Module 4: Qualitative Predictors and Model Building**
    *   Theory: Dummy variables, Interaction terms, Variable selection (Stepwise).
    *   RStudio: Handling factors, `step()` function.
5.  **Module 5: Active Learning & Case Studies**
    *   Activity: Real-world data analysis project.
    *   Exercises: Comprehensive problem sets with solutions.

## Learning Objectives
*   Understand the mathematical foundations of regression.
*   Perform manual calculations for small datasets.
*   Conduct professional statistical analysis using RStudio.
*   Interpret results and communicate findings effectively.
